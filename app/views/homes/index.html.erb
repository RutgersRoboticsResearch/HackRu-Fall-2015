  				<h2>The organizing team at HackRU would like to invite you to be a part of the ninth biannual HackRU!</h2>
  				<p>
  					The event is a 24-hour hackathon held every semester at Rutgers University. We are the largest student run educational event on campus and the second oldest student run hackathon. In its 4 years, HackRU has grown from an event of 50 students to boasting over 1000 attendees at this past spring&#39s event. This fall, 800 hackers will come together to envision, create, and demo their own unique application. 
  				</p> 
  				<p> 
  					At the start of the hackathon, our sponsoring companies will present their technologies. Participants will these technologies in your applications to push your hacking up to the cutting edge. Throughout the day, you will be surrounded by mentors from our sponsors and fellow hackers who will help you hack like a battle axe.
  				</p>
  				<p>
  					At the end of 24 hours, a panel of judges will assemble and award awesome prizes.  Everyone will get fed, receive sweet swag, and meet amazing people. We promise you won’t go home hungry and without having gained knowledge.
